DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM:

Delhi and Bangalore are two of the major metropolitan cities in India.

They are vibrant and multi-cultural.

In this project I will be diving deep into their neighborhoods and find the similarities and dissimilarities between them on the basis of food.
DISCUSSION OF THE BACKGROOUND:

The people of these cities have been on each other's necks for decades to prove that they are superior in culture to the other. In this project I wil settle this debate once and for all on the basis of the most important aspect of them all: FOOD

The similarity and dissimilarity will be decided on the basis of their goods. There can be one of the following conditions:

The food in Delhi is completely similar to the food in Bangalore.

The variety of food in Delhi is a subset of the variety of food in Bangalore.

The variety of food in Mumbai is a susbset of the variety of food in Bangalore.

WHO IS THIS PROJECT FOR:

This project is suitable for anyone who is a foodie and wants to shift residence to either of these cities. This project provides a solution to all of their problems.
